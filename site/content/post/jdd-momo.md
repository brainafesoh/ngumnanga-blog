description: Ulysses, Ulysses — Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of
  Earth, flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses — Fighting evil and tyranny,
  with all his power, and with all of his might. Ulysses — no-one else can do
  the things you do. Ulysses — like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses —
  always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.

There’s a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that’s where I’ll always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

![Is a goal](img/blog-chemex.jpg "It's a goal")

I never spend much time in school but I taught ladies plenty. It’s true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey. I’ve gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up for Raquel Welch. But when I end up in the hay it’s only hay, hey hey. I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine. ’Cause I’m the unknown stuntman that makes Eastwood look so fine.
